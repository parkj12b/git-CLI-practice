This project will demonstrate what i know so far Javascript,
git, github and commandline(WSL2).

This will be a simple project. I am going to collect many strings 
of interesting fact and store them in an array.

Each time the program is ran it will spit out an interesting fact 
from the array.

There are 10 interesting facts in total. It will choose a random
index between 0 to 9 to spit out one of the interesting facts.

To extend this project i'll try to webscrap 1000 strings from i'm 
feeling curious from google and store them in funFacts to make it 
more random.
